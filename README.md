# Contact Tracing Beta App

Final Group Project Utilizing all technology learned

This Application is designed as a contact tracing App easily usable by small businesses. 

It has two login and profile components, one for the diner, where the diner can log in and based on their geolocation be checked in to the closest restaurant.

It has a separate login for restaurant owners where the owner can log in and utilize Google Map API to locate their restaurant and register it. There is a second part for the owners where they can select a restaurant they've registered and then pull up the recent guest logs for that restaurant. This will provide small business owners an easy way to keep track of guests that visited for contact tracing purposes.

Technology Used: React, Express, Sequelize, mySQL, Google Map API.
